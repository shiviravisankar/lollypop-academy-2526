<h3><span style="font-family: 'Tabular', monospace; text-transform: uppercase;">üéØ Goal</span></h3>
<p>Develop a structured approach to identifying patterns and insights. Learn to objectively analyze and evaluate information, challenge assumptions, recognize biases, and uncover meaningful connections.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p><span style="font-style: italic; color: blue;">"As UX Designers, we're constantly making decisions - about users, interfaces and experiences. But how do we ensure that our decisions are truly user-centered and not based on personal biases, assumptions, or surface-level data? That's where critical thinking comes in."</span></p>

    <h2>Are Biases and Assumptions Always Wrong in UX?</h2>
    <ul></ul>
    <li>We often hear that biases and assumptions are bad, but are they always?</li>
    <li>Can we design a user experience without making any assumptions?</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="bias">
<div class="left">
    <p>Biases are mental shortcuts that help us process information quickly. They aren&#39;t inherently bad, but they can lead to design decisions that exclude or misrepresent users. Some common UX-related biases include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><span style="font-weight: 500; font-style: italic;">Confirmation Bias</span> &#8208; Favoring data that supports our existing beliefs.</li>
        <li><span style="font-weight: 500; font-style: italic;">Recency Bias</span> &#8208; Giving more weight to recent feedback rather than long-term trends.</li>
        <li><span style="font-weight: 500; font-style: italic;">Cultural Bias</span> &#8208; Designing for one&#39;s own cultural norms and neglecting diversity.</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div class="right">
    <p><span style="font-style: italic; color: blue;">"When starting a project, you assume users want a feature before testing it. Is this assumption bad? Or does it give us a starting point for research?"</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-style: italic; color: blue;">"What happens if we design without any assumptions? Wouldn&#39;t that mean endless research with no decisions made?"</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="assumption">
<div class="left">
<h3>Assumptions drive the initial stages of design.</h3>
<p>Without them, we wouldn&#39;t have hypotheses to test. However, the key is to validate assumptions through research and data rather than blindly relying on them.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>üïµÔ∏è Use assumptions as a hypothesis, not a conclusion.</p>
<p>ü§î Be aware of biases and actively question them.</p>
<p>‚úÖ Validate decisions with real user data.</p>
</div>
</div>

<h2>For Example,</h2>
<div class="example1">
    <div class="left">
        <h3>Facebook's "Year in Review"</h3>
        <p>Facebook auto-generated a "Year in Review" for users, highlighting their most engaging photos. While many users were delighted, for some the algorithm resurfaced painful memories, like a loved one's passing or a tragic event. Facebook assumed that <span style="color: blue; font-style: italic;">engagement = happiness</span>, without critically evaluating how different contexts could impact the user experience.</p>
        <p><span style="font-style: italic; color: blue;">What other metrics could have been evaluated to create this review?</span></p>
    </div>

<div class="example2">
    <div class="left">
        <h3>LinkedIn's Biased Job Recommendation Algorithm"</h3>
        <p>LinkedIn's job recommendation algorithm tended to suggest higher-paying jobs to men than to women, even when their profiles were similar. The algorithms learned from existing hiring patterns, <span style="color: blue; font-style: italic;">reinforcing systemic gender bias</span>.</p>
        <p><span style="font-style: italic; color: blue;">UX and AI teams must audit algorithms for bias, what unseen factors are influencing decisions?</span></p>

    <h3><span style="font-style: italic; color: #FD2E35;">Spot the Bias + The 5 Whys</span></h3>
        <p>‚òùÔ∏è Take a real-world UX case study or a popular app's interface. Critique it, identifying potential biases (e.g., cultural, accessibility, gender, or age-related biases).</p>
        <p>
            ‚úåÔ∏è Suggest improvements based on a more objective, inclusive perspective.
        </p>
        <p>üëå Apply the 5 Whys Technique to dig deeper into the root cause to refine their problem-solving approach using this framework.</p>
