<li>How do we know if the new chair is actually helpful?</li>
<li>Wouldn't it be better if we actually spoke to real elderly people with back pain?</li>

<h2>Why Research is the Foundation of Great Design</h2>
</div>

<div class="about">
<div class="left">
<p>UX research is the process of understanding user behaviors, needs, and motivations through observation and feedback. It helps designers make informed decisions rather than relying on assumptions, leading to better usability and business outcomes.</p>
<p>Good UX research ensures that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Products solve real user problems.</li>
<li>Design decisions are backed by data.</li>
<li>Users have a seamless and enjoyable experience.</li>
<li>Businesses reduce costly redesigns and failures.</li>

<h2>Types of UX Research</h2>
</div>

<div class="research-types-container">
<div class="research-type-card">
<h3>Attitudinal Research</h3>
<p>Focuses on what users say they do (e.g., surveys, interviews).</p>
</div>

<div class="research-type-card">
<h3>Behavioral Research</h3>
<p>Observes what users actually do (e.g., usability testing, heatmaps).</p>
</div>

<div class="research-type-card">
<h3>Qualitative Research</h3>
<p>Explores why users behave a certain way (e.g., interviews, ethnographic studies).</p>
</div>

<div class="research-type-card">
<h3>Quantitative Research</h3>
<p>Measures what is happening using numerical data (e.g., A/B testing, analytics).</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="line"></div>

<div class="section-title">
<h2>Deep Dive: Attitudinal vs. Behavioral Research</h2>
<p>This distinction helps you understand what people say vs. what they do.</p>
</div>

<div class="research-method">
<h4>Use Attitudinal Research When:</h4>
<ul>
<li>✅ You need to understand user opinions, perceptions, and preferences.</li>
<li>✅ You want to learn why users make decisions.</li>
<li>✅ You're in the early discovery phase and want to explore pain points.</li>
</ul>

<h4>💡 Example Methods:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Surveys – To gather opinions on feature preferences.</li>
<li>Interviews – To explore motivations behind behaviors.</li>
<li>Focus Groups – To discuss expectations or experiences.</li>
</ul>

<h4>🛑 Limitations:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Users often don't accurately predict their own behavior.</li>
<li>Responses can be biased or influenced by the setting or the way questions are framed.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="research-method">
<h4>Use Behavioral Research When:</h4>
<ul>
<li>✅ You need to understand how users actually interact with a product.</li>
<li>✅ You're testing usability, friction points, or real-world usage patterns.</li>
<li>✅ You're refining an existing product or validating a prototype.</li>
</ul>

<h4>💡 Example Methods:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Usability Testing – To observe where users struggle in a design.</li>
<li>Heatmaps & Session Recordings – To track how users navigate an interface.</li>
<li>A/B Testing – To compare different design variations based on actual user behavior.</li>
</ul>

<h4>🛑 Limitations:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Doesn't always explain why users behave a certain way.</li>
<li>Requires more time and resources to conduct effectively.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
</div>

<div class="about">
<div class="left">
<p>Choosing the right research method depends on whether you need subjective opinions (attitudinal) or objective behavior data (behavioral), and whether you're looking for in-depth insights (qualitative) or measurable trends (quantitative). The best approach often combines multiple research types to balance what users say with what they actually do.</p>

</div>

<div class="research-brief">
<h3>1️⃣ IRCTC Rail Connect - Redesign Brief</h3>
<p>The IRCTC Rail Connect app is essential for millions of Indians booking train tickets, yet it suffers from a complex booking process, slow performance, and usability issues for diverse user groups (frequent travelers, senior citizens, first-time users). The goal is to redesign the experience to make ticket booking seamless, reduce friction in navigation, and improve accessibility across different user demographics.</p>
</div>

<div class="research-brief">
<h3>2️⃣ BHIM UPI - Redesign Brief</h3>
<p>Despite being India's flagship UPI app, BHIM has lost traction to competitors like PhonePe and Google Pay due to an outdated UI, a confusing onboarding flow, and a lack of advanced features that make digital payments feel effortless. The goal is to revamp the user experience by simplifying payments, improving trust signals, and making digital transactions intuitive and friction-free.</p>

<div class="interview-section">
<h3>🟢 Good vs. Bad Interview Practices</h3>

<div class="interview-practices">
<div class="bad-practice">
<h4>🚫 <span>Bad Practices:</span></h4>
<p>❌ Asking leading or biased questions</p>
<ul>
<li>"Don't you think the IRCTC app is slow and frustrating?"</li>
<li>"Wouldn't you prefer if BHIM looked like Google Pay?"</li>
<li>"Do you like this feature?" (Binary responses = limited insights)</li>
</ul>

<p>❌ Asking vague or hypothetical questions</p>
<ul>
<li>"How often do you book train tickets?" (What does 'often' mean?)</li>
<li>"Would you use the app if it had feature X?" (People say yes, but real behavior may differ)</li>
</ul>

<p>❌ Stacking multiple questions into one</p>
<ul>
<li>"Do you think the IRCTC app is slow, confusing, and hard to use?" (Which issue are they referring to?)</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="good-practice">
<h4>✅ <span>Good Practices:</span></h4>
<p>✔️ Use open-ended questions to get detailed insights</p>
<ul>
<li>"Tell me about the last time you booked a train ticket—what was your experience like?"</li>
<li>"Walk me through how you usually send money using UPI. What challenges do you face?"</li>
</ul>

<p>✔️ Keep questions neutral and non-leading</p>
<ul>
<li>"What do you think about the IRCTC app's booking process?"</li>
<li>"How do you feel about using BHIM UPI compared to other payment apps?"</li>
</ul>

<p>✔️ Ask for specific examples & behaviors</p>
<ul>
<li>"Can you describe a time when you faced a problem while booking a ticket?"</li>
<li>"What do you do when a UPI transaction fails? What's your next step?"</li>
</ul>

<p>✔️ Follow up with why and how</p>
<ul>
<li>"You mentioned the IRCTC app takes time—why do you think that happens?"</li>
<li>"What made you choose BHIM UPI over other apps, if at all?"</li>
</ul>

<h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
<ul>
<li>Keep it conversational – don't just go down a list; adapt based on their responses.</li>
<li>Listen more, talk less – let users tell their stories.</li>
<li>Observe behaviors, not just words – what they do often matters more than what they say.</li>

<div class="activity">
<h2>In-Class Activity: "Keep the Conversation Going!"</h2>
<div class="activity-content">
<div class="left">
<h3>Objective:</h3>
<p>Help participants practice open-ended questioning and active listening by keeping a conversation flowing—without letting it end abruptly!</p>

<h3>How It Works:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pair Up</strong> – Each participant pairs with a partner.</li>
<li><strong>Pick a General Topic</strong> – Participants choose everyday topics like:
<ul>
<li>Ordering food online 🍔</li>
<li>Buying something from an e-commerce website 🛒</li>
<li>Using a ride-hailing app 🚖</li>
<li>Planning a weekend trip 🏖</li>
<li>Booking a doctor's appointment online 🏥</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Start the Conversation</strong> – One person starts by asking a broad, open-ended question.</li>
<li><strong>Answer with a Question!</strong> – The second person responds, but instead of answering directly, they must continue the conversation by framing their response as another question.</li>
<li><strong>Keep It Going</strong> – The goal is to continue the conversation for at least 5 rounds without letting it stall!</li>
</ul>

<h3>Reflection & Debrief:</h3>
<ul>
<li>What was challenging about keeping the conversation going?</li>
<li>Did any responses spark unexpected insights?</li>
<li>How did reframing answers as questions change the way you explored the topic?</li>
</ul>
